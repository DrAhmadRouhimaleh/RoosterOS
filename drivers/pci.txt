Key enhancements:

Full 8/16/32-bit PCI config reads and writes with proper masking.

Data structure (pci_device_t) capturing vendor/device IDs, class codes, header type, IRQ, and BAR details.

Automatic BAR sizing via all-1 probe and size mask extraction.

Multi-function device support and PCI-to-PCI bridge recursive bus scanning.

Global device table with lookup by vendor/device ID.

Clean separation of raw I/O, low-level probe, and high-level enumeration.

You can extend this further by:

Parsing the PCI capability linked list (offset 0x34) for MSI/MSI-X or power management.

Allocating and tracking MMIO and I/O port windows for OS resource management.

Integrating hot-plug notifications for PCI Express buses.
