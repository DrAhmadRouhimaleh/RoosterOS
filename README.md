# üêì RoosterOS ‚Äî The Bare-Metal Phoenix

RoosterOS is a modular, multi-language operating system that targets both real-world performance and educational clarity. The actual kernel is written in Assembly, C, Rust, and Go to deliver low-level control, safety, and speed, while a parallel Python implementation simulates every step of the x86 boot process‚Äîfrom real-mode segment setup and A20 gate to GDT/IDT loading, paging, and protected-mode handoff‚Äîenabling rapid prototyping, testing, and learning.

The project‚Äôs design and documentation have been enriched with the assistance of Copilot AI, ensuring consistent structure and thorough coverage of each subsystem. All code and simulation components are provided for personal and educational use only; commercial use of RoosterOS in any form is strictly prohibited. 

Our primary goal is to design an operating system that spans the spectrum from legacy 16-bit machines to modern hardware, serving as a viable alternative to Windows. It will feature a clean, user-friendly graphical interface that performs smoothly even on 16-bit platforms or systems with as little as 64 MB of RAM.

We plan to support a wide array of languages‚Äîincluding English, Persian, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Korean, Russian, German, Spanish, Italian, French, Somali, Berber, Amharic, Oromo, Igbo, Swahili, Hausa, Mandinka, Fulani, many other African languages, and more‚Äîthough initially we will implement full support for English, Persian, Arabic, and possibly Chinese.
